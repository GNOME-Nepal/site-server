# Djate
| acronym for Django Awesome Template 

## What is Djate?
Djate is a simple yet effective Django template that is beginner-friendly and intended for production use (in future). Its core focus is on simplifying Django app setup and configuration using Docker, with a goal of eventually being production-ready.

## Purpose
The purpose of this template is to simplify testing in Django, making it quick and easy without the hassle of manual setup. Instead of manually installing packages like `django-rest-framework`, `celery`, `celery-backend`, and `flower`, you can get everything up and running with just one click and a single command.

## Physical Architecture
When you run the following command, the setup will be created using `docker-compose`.

### Webserver:
The webserver is based on Django and comes preinstalled with Django, Django REST framework (DRF), `drf_yasg` for API documentation, and other essential packages. You can find the full list of dependencies in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/GNOME-Nepal/site-server/blob/main/requirements.txt).

### Database:
The default database used in Djate is SQLite, as itâ€™s lightweight and suitable for quick testing and learning about Django internals. However, there's an open discussion to consider switching to PostgreSQL as the default database. You can vote [here](https://github.com/n1rjal/djate/issues/1).

### Message Queue:
Djate uses Redis as the message queue for Celery. Redis is a popular and efficient transport for managing background tasks in Django.

### Flower:
Flower is included for Celery task monitoring. It allows you to monitor the status of Celery tasks and queues.
Flower runs on port `7777` with the following default credentials:

**Username:** admin  
**Password:** pswd

## Features
Djate comes pre-installed with the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue/job queue for handling background tasks.
- **Redis**: Used as the message broker for Celery.
- **Flower**: A web-based tool for monitoring Celery tasks.
- **Docker**: Djate is containerized using Docker for easier deployment and testing.

## Code Architecture:
Djate follows the standard Django project structure with `apps` and `manage.py` in the root directory. Each app has components such as `views.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py`, etc. Celery tasks are defined in `tasks.py` for each application.

The code architecture also leverages Django REST Framework (DRF) generics and viewsets for building APIs efficiently.
